# Euler method approximation example

This is a Python script used to demonstrate how the Euler method for approximating first order ordinary differential equations works. The code stores y values at different points into an array, then uses them to graph the approximate solution via matplotlib along with the exact solution. 

This was done for a school project. The document is commented very heavily for the sake of presenting an in depth view of the algorithm to the class.
